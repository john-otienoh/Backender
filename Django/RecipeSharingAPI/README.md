# Build Your Own Recipe Sharing API

## Project Description

The "Recipe Sharing API" project aims to develop an API where users can share, search for, and interact with recipes. This API will enable users to create accounts, save their favorite recipes, and engage with the community by rating and commenting on recipes. By providing a platform for culinary enthusiasts to discover and exchange recipes, this API aims to foster a vibrant cooking community.

## Detailed Description

Sharing recipes has become a popular way for food enthusiasts to connect, discover new dishes, and showcase their culinary creations. This project will create an API that facilitates seamless recipe sharing, searching, and interaction among users. Hereâ€™s a detailed look at how users will interact with the app:

1. User Registration and Authentication:

- Sign Up: New users can create an account by providing a username, email, and password. A confirmation email will be sent to verify the account.

- Login: Registered users can log in using their email and password. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) will be supported for enhanced security.

1. Recipe Management:

- Create Recipes: Users can create and publish their own recipes, including ingredients, cooking instructions, and photos.

- Search Recipes: Users can search for recipes based on keywords, ingredients, cuisine types, and dietary preferences.

- Save Favorite Recipes: Users can save recipes to their profile for quick access later.

1. Community Interaction:

- Rate Recipes: Users can rate recipes based on their experience and provide feedback.

- Comment on Recipes: Users can leave comments on recipes, ask questions, or share tips and modifications.

- Follow Users: Users can follow other cooks to stay updated on their latest recipes and activity.

1. Social Features:

- Share Recipes: Users can share recipes with friends via email, social media, or direct messaging within the app.

- Tagging and Categorization: Recipes can be tagged and categorized by cuisine type, meal type (e.g., breakfast, dinner), and dietary restrictions (e.g., vegetarian, gluten-free).

1. Notifications:

- Activity Notifications: Users receive notifications when someone likes their recipe, comments on their recipe, or follows them.
