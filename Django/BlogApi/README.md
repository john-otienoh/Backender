# Django Rest Framework - Blog Platform :metal:

## Blog Platform with User Authentication Using Django Rest Framework

This project focuses on building a robust and scalable Blog Platform where users can interact with the platform by creating, editing, and managing their blog posts.
It leverages Django Rest Framework (DRF) for the backend and uses SQLite or PostgreSQL as the database, with a focus on user authentication and seamless user experience.

1. User Authentication

**User Registration, Login, and Password Recovery**</br>
The first step in building a secure blog platform is implementing a reliable authentication system. This includes the following features:

- User Registration: New users can sign up by providing their basic details (such as email and password). Once registered, a user can immediately log in to the system.
- User Login: Users can authenticate themselves using their registered email and password. This involves validating the credentials against the database and establishing a user session.
- Password Recovery: If users forget their passwords, they can request a password reset link via email. This feature typically includes sending a one-time token that allows the user to change their password securely.
**Security Considerations**
- Password Hashing: Django provides built-in methods to hash passwords securely so that plaintext passwords are never stored in the database.
- Token-based Authentication: DRF typically uses token-based authentication (via JSON Web Tokens or JWT) to securely manage user sessions.After login, the user receives an authentication token that they send with each request to verify their identity.

## Blog Post Management

Create, Edit, and Delete Blog Posts
Once users are authenticated, they should be able to create, edit, and delete their own blog posts. This feature is essential for providing a content management system (CMS) that is user-friendly and dynamic.

- Write Blog Posts: Users can create blog posts by filling out forms that accept text, images, or even embedded videos. The blog posts will be stored in the database with information like the title, content, publication date, and author.  
- Edit Blog Posts: Users can modify their posts at any time, whether it’s for fixing typos, adding new content, or improving the formatting. The system must ensure only the original authors can edit or update their own posts.
- Delete Blog Posts: Users should have the option to delete their posts if they no longer wish to keep them on the platform. Deleting a post also means removing all associated data, such as comments.
**Backend Considerations**
- DRF’s ModelSerializer: Can be used to serialize blog posts for API responses, while APIView can handle requests related to creating, editing, or deleting posts.
- Permissions: DRF's permission classes can be used to ensure that users can only edit or delete their own posts, ensuring proper access control.

## Commenting System with Moderation Features

Post Comments and Comment Moderation
A commenting system is a key component for creating interactive and engaging content on the platform. It allows users to comment on each other's posts, fostering communication and discussion.

- Post Comments: Users can leave comments on individual blog posts. These comments may be in the form of plain text or could support rich text (such as Markdown or HTML.
- Comment Moderation: To maintain a healthy environment, the platform should include basic moderation features such as:
- Flagging inappropriate comments.
- Reporting abusive behavior.
- Admins or post authors can delete offensive comments or ban users who consistently violate platform rules.
**Backend Considerations**
- API Endpoints: DRF can handle the API endpoints for posting, editing, and deleting comments.
- Moderation Workflow: Admins can have a backend view (or admin panel) to review flagged comments before they are published.

## User Dashboard and Post Statistics

Managing Posts and Viewing Statistics
The User Dashboard provides an overview of a user's activity and content on the platform. It is the personal space where users can track their posts and engagement (such as views or comments).

- Manage Posts: Users can see a list of all their posts, along with options to edit or delete them. This allows for easy post management and interaction with their content
- Post Statistics: This could include:
- Post Views: Tracking how many times their posts have been viewed.
- Comment Count: Seeing how many comments each post has received.
- Engagement Rate: This could be a calculation that shows how many likes, comments, and shares a post gets in comparison to its views.
**Backend Considerations**
- Aggregating Data: Views and comments would need to be stored and aggregated for each post. For instance, a user’s post view count can be incremented every time a user visits a post.
- Dashboard API: DRF would expose an API endpoint to retrieve the user’s statistics, aggregating the necessary data and presenting it in a user-friendly format.

## Admin Panel for Managing Posts, Users, and Comments

Admin Functionality - An admin panel is critical for overseeing the entire platform. It allows administrators to monitor user activities, manage content, and enforce platform rules.

- Post Management: Admins can view, edit, or delete any post. They can also flag or delete posts that violate the platform’s guidelines.
- User Management: Admins can view user profiles, manage accounts (e.g., disable accounts, reset passwords), and monitor user activity.
- Comment Moderation: Admins should be able to moderate comments across all posts, remove inappropriate comments, and manage reported content.
**Admin Panel in Django**
Django comes with a built-in admin panel that can be easily customized to suit the needs of the platform. Admins can view a list of posts, comments, and users, and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations directly from the interface.

## Technologies Used

- Django: The project leverages Django as the web framework, providing features such as Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture, robust security features, and easy database management.
- Django Rest Framework (DRF): DRF is used to build the API for handling CRUD operations on posts, comments, and user data. DRF’s flexible serializers and authentication mechanisms make it ideal for building RESTful APIs.
- SQLite/PostgreSQL: SQLite is used for smaller, development environments while PostgreSQL is recommended for production, especially when scaling the platform.
- Bootstrap: The front-end of the blog platform uses Bootstrap for responsive design and clean, modern UI. Bootstrap helps ensure that the platform is mobile-friendly and accessible across different devices and screen sizes.
